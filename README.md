Project Overview
1. Environment Setup
Environment Variables: The project uses environment variables, such as NAS_PATH, to define file paths dynamically. This allows the script to be more flexible and portable across different environments.
Logger Setup: A logger is configured to track the progress and any issues that arise during the execution of the script. This helps in debugging and monitoring.
2. Loading the Excel File
The script loads an Excel file using the pandas library. This file contains different segments of data, each corresponding to different types of trades (e.g., Equity, Futures & Options, Commodities).
3. Processing Segments
The Excel file is divided into different segments, each of which contains specific trading data. The segments include:
Equity Segment
Futures & Options Segment
Commodities Segment
For each segment, the script:
Identifies the relevant rows and columns.
Sets the appropriate headers.
Filters out any rows where the 'Security Name' is NaN.
Extracts the data for further processing.
4. Cleaning and Saving Data
The cleaned data for each segment is saved as individual CSV files in a specified directory (Unrealized within the NAS path).
The script also sums the "Realized P&L" for each segment and calculates the total "Realized P&L" across all segments.
5. Combining Segments
After processing each segment, the data is combined into a single DataFrame, which is then saved as a combined CSV file (Combined_Segments_Unrealized.csv).
The script ensures that the combined file is saved successfully and prints a confirmation message.
6. Output
Individual CSV Files: Cleaned data for each segment is saved as a separate CSV file.
Combined CSV File: All segments are combined into a single CSV file.
Summary: The total "Realized P&L" across all segments is calculated and displayed.
Purpose and Benefits
Data Cleaning: The project ensures that only relevant, clean data is retained, removing any rows with missing or irrelevant information.
Modular Design: Each part of the process, from loading data to saving results, is modular, making it easier to maintain and extend the script.
Automated Processing: The script automates the entire process of data extraction, cleaning, and saving, reducing manual effort and the potential for errors.
Flexibility: The use of environment variables and logging makes the script adaptable to different environments and easier to troubleshoot.
Potential Use Cases


Trading Analysis: The cleaned and processed data can be used for further analysis in tools like Power BI or Excel, helping traders make informed decisions.
Reporting: The project can be integrated into a larger reporting system, where the processed data is used to generate financial reports.
Automation: By automating the data processing pipeline, the project saves time and ensures consistency in the data used for analysis and reporting.
This project is a solid foundation for automating the processing of trading data, ensuring that the data is clean, well-organized, and ready for analysis or reporting.
